    <h3 id="head-info">Here's a time line of Marie Currie:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1867</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Poland: On November 7, 1867, Marie Sk≈Çodowska, later known as Marie Curie, was born in Warsaw, Poland. Her inquisitive mind and passion for science were evident from an early age.</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - Moves to Paris for Higher Education: In pursuit of higher education, Marie moved to Paris in 1891. She attended the Sorbonne University, where she excelled in physics and mathematics despite facing financial hardships.</li>
        <li><strong>1893</strong> - Begins Research in Radioactivity: Marie's fascination with the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity led her to start research in this field. She would later become the first person to use the term "radioactivity."</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong> - Marries Pierre Curie: Marie married Pierre Curie, a renowned physicist whom she had met while working in the laboratory. Their scientific collaboration and deep love for each other would be instrumental in their future discoveries.</li>
        <li><strong>1898</strong> - Discovers Polonium: Marie, along with her husband Pierre, discovered the element polonium, named after Marie's homeland, Poland. This marked the first time a new element was isolated by a woman.</li>
        <li><strong>1902</strong> - Receives Doctorate in Science: Marie Curie completed her doctoral thesis on the radioactivity of compounds and earned her Doctorate in Science, becoming the first woman to receive a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne.</li>
        <li><strong>1903</strong> - Shares Nobel Prize in Physics: Marie Curie, along with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Marie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.</li>
        <li><strong>1906</strong> - Becomes a Widow: The scientific community suffered a great loss when Pierre Curie tragically died in a road accident in 1906. Marie carried on their work and legacy, dedicating herself to furthering their research</li>
        <li><strong>1911</strong> - Receives Second Nobel Prize: Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discoveries of radium and polonium and her pioneering work in the field of radioactivity. She became the first person, male or female, to win Nobel Prizes in multiple scientific disciplines.</li>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - <strong>1918</strong> - Contributions during World War I: During World War I, Marie Curie's expertise in radiology proved invaluable. She developed mobile X-ray units and trained medical personnel in their use, providing essential medical support to injured soldiers</li>
        <li><strong>1921</strong> - Establishes the Radium Institute in Warsaw: Marie Curie returned to her native Poland and established the Radium Institute in Warsaw, where she continued her research and provided training for future scientists.</li>
        <li><strong>1934</strong> - Marie Curie's Passing: On July 4, 1934, Marie Curie passed away in Sancellemoz, France, succumbing to aplastic anemia caused by prolonged exposure to radiation during her scientific work.</li>
         </ul>
